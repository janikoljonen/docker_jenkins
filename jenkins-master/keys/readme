Create ssh key pair for master -> slave 
1. ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
2. Enter a passphrase if you want one (needed in Jenkins later!)
3. Choose: ./id_rsa as your file location
4. ls -la
5. Confirm “id_rsa” and “id_rsa.pub” are created
6. mv id_rsa.pub jenkins-slave/files/authorized_keys
7. add the id_rsa to jenkins credentials as a private key
